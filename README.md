[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/max-npm-quality.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/max-npm-quality) ![build](https://github.com/BasLee/max-npm-quality/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Optimize the npm quality score of your (typescript) project on npmjs.org by adding these files:
- index.js
- package.json
- README.md
- index.test.ts

Current quality score: [80%](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=max-npm-quality)

The documentation of npmjs.org states:
> Quality includes considerations such as the presence of a README file, stability, tests, up-to-date dependencies, custom website, and code complexity.
[sourc](https://docs.npmjs.com/searching-for-and-choosing-packages-to-download#quality)
 
This minimal project is a proof of concept, testing the files that npmjs.org uses to determine the quality score of packages.
It is work in progress: you know how to improve this score? Please create an issue or submit a PR :D
